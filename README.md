# Resarch-Finance-Board
This is my first open source project to build a finance dashboard in python for my investment researches.

# ToDoÂ´s
- Create a minimal Webapplication with python (django).
- Build a "static" webscrapper (scrapes a fixed list of links)
- Build a "dynamic" webscrapper where you can input new links to scrape through.
- Create a hook/trigger -> Executes Daily
- Create DB (SQL) to store everything.

# Future Developements

- Create a plattform for more than one user to use.
